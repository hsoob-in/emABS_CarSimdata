#EMBEDDED_NOTES
#VS Command STOP_RUN_NOW is used to trigger the simulation to end. The keyword is typed and a user defined message may be displayed after the keyword.  The message may be seen in the Log file by using the View button on the Run screen.
#
#Linking to an event like this, instead of simply linking to nothing (which will also end the run), serves as a reminder that the run is intentionally ended, and notice that a link wasn't broken or just forgotten.
