#EMBEDDED_NOTES
#WRITE_ALL is a parameter to write outputs to file continuously. It is normally 0, but can be reset from the Run Control screen for diagnostics.
#
#IPRINT is set to 1 to enable writing as soon as OPT_WRITE is set to 1, usually just for one time step.
#
#T_WAIT is the time used to wait for the vehicle to settle into a steady-state condition for most of the circle tests. The first one can take longer, so the wait time is multiplied by 3 in the pending event.
