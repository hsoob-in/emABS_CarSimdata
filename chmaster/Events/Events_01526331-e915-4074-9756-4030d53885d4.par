#EMBEDDED_NOTES
#Use the speed controller for vehicle #1 to stop at a stop sign.
#
#To do this, set the current target speed to the dataset STOP_ID, which goes to zero speed. Change the  gain of the table to the current speed. Offset the station in the table by taking into account the vehicle position (Station), the distance to the stop sign (detect_dist(s1,1)), and the distance from the sign when the vehicle should stop (detect_msg(s1,1)).
#
#Define a pending event to be triggered when the vehicle speed is near zero.
