#EMBEDDED_NOTES
#The yaw rate difference is ideally zero, meaning the path is maintained despite the throttle lift.
#
#If the yaw rate difference is positive, the vehicle has veered inside the original path, potentially into oncoming traffic.
#
#If the yaw rate difference is negative, the vehicle is has veered outside the original path, potentially into adjacent traffic.
#
#The positive/negative means assumes a positive yaw rate test (vehicle steering to left).
