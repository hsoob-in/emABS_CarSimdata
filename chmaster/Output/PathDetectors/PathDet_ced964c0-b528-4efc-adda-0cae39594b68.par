#EMBEDDED_NOTES
#This dataset and its children
#(a) install the path detection feature
#(b) set its path and ltarg IDs to match that seen by the driver model
#(c) create moving objects to represent the detected path, and
#(d) plot the available path detector outputs.
#
#The path detector coordinate system has a user specifiable origin. The path detector axis directions are those of the intermediate axis system.
#
#The path detector fits an approximate clothoid, whose coordinates in the path detector coordinate system are given by
#
#y = CurvRatePd/6*x^3+CurvPd/2*x^2+YoffsetPd
#
#The curve fit is based on the target points, but does not necessarily interpolate them exactly.
#
#As this is a clothoidal approximation, curvature at other points is calculated in the path detector coordinate system by
#
#curvature(x) = CurvRatePd*x + CurvPd
