#To run this example in Windows:
#1) click Open Model or Generate FMU
#2) in Simulink, click the run button
#3) review results from Vehicle 2
#
#V: Video
#P: Plot
#
#Each vehicle in the platoon uses a shared simulink model that leverages parallel solvers to simulate the vehicles across multiple CarSim Runs.
#
#In this example, each vehicle also has painted tire paths, to show the paths of the vehicle.
#
#The vehicles following the lead vehicle have negative station values so that they may properly obtain steering reference values from the vehicle(s) in front of them
#
#Up to 20 vehicles can be used with this multiple solver example, however you will need enough parallel licenses more than two vehicles
