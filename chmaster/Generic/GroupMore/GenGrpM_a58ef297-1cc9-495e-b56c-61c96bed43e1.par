*MODELCODE I_I

#EMBEDDED_NOTES
#This is a setup for a vehicle with a sensor  to run with other vehicles. It sets the run color yellow before the four blue links that:
#
#1. link to a vehicle dataset,
#2. link to a sensor,
#3. link to a set of VS Commands specifici for vehicle #4, and the first Event dataset in a chain that is specific for vehicle #4.
#4. link to a target object that is attached to the sprung mass, such that vehicle #4 can be detected by other vehicles.
#
#Feel free to change the vehicle dataset used with the first link. However, be sure to update the dataset code for this dataset if need to match that of the vehicle.
